    "### 1. Overview\n",
    "The learning objective of this lab is for students to understand how environment variables affect program\n",
    "and system behaviors. Environment variables are a set of dynamic named values that can affect the way\n",
    "running processes will behave on a computer. They are used by most operating systems, since they were\n",
    "introduced to Unix in 1979. Although environment variables affect program behaviors, how they achieve\n",
    "that is not well understood by many programmers. As a result, if a program uses environment variables,\n",
    "but the programmer does not know that they are used, the program may have vulnerabilities. In this lab,\n",
    "students will understand how environment variables work, how they are propagated from parent process to\n",
    "child, and how they affect system/program behaviors. We are particularly interested in how environment\n",
    "variables affect the behavior of Set-UID programs, which are usually privileged programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab covers the following topics:\n",
    "- Environment variables\n",
    "- Set-UID programs\n",
    "- Securely invoke external programs\n",
    "- Capability leaking\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Task 1: Manipulating Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we study the commands that can be used to set and unset environment variables. We are using\n",
    "Bash in the seed account. Please do the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use printenv or env command to print out the environment variables. If you are interested in\n",
    "some particular environment variables, such as PWD, you can use `printenv PWD` or `env |\n",
    "grep PWD`.\n",
    "- Use export and unset to set or unset environment variables. It should be noted that these two\n",
    "commands are not seperate programs; they are two of the Bash’s internal commands (you will not be\n",
    "able to find them outside of Bash).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Task 2: Passing Environment Variables from Parent Process to Child Process\n",
    "In this task, we study how a child process gets its environment variables from its parent. In Unix, `fork()`\n",
    "creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process, referred to as the child, is an\n",
    "exact duplicate of the calling process, referred to as the parent; however, several things are not inherited by\n",
    "the child (please see the manual of `fork()` by typing the following command: `man fork`). In this task,\n",
    "we would like to know whether the parent’s environment variables are inherited by the child process or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1:\n",
    "Please compile and run the following program, and describe your observation. Because the output\n",
    "contains many strings, you should save the output into a file, such as using `a.out > child` (assuming\n",
    "that `a.out` is your executable file name)."
